Machine Learning with Python

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data.

Python has become the go-to language for machine learning due to its simplicity and powerful libraries. Some popular machine learning libraries in Python include:

Scikit-learn: A comprehensive library for classical machine learning algorithms.
TensorFlow: Google's open-source library for deep learning.
PyTorch: Facebook's dynamic neural network library.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API.

Data preprocessing is crucial in machine learning. Python's pandas library makes it easy to clean, transform, and analyze data before feeding it to machine learning models.

Popular machine learning tasks include:
- Classification: Predicting categories or labels
- Regression: Predicting continuous values
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points
- Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the number of features

Python's ecosystem makes it easy to implement end-to-end machine learning pipelines from data collection to model deployment.
